          <p>Confused by website terminology?</p>

          <p>
            If so, here’s a handy glossary (all in plain English) that’ll
            quickly get you up to speed and demystify the language of web
            technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you understand basic website jargon, you’ll never get
            intimidated or befuddled the next time a web designer or web
            developer spews techno-babble.

          <h2>Basic Anatomy Of A Website</h2>

          <p>Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>

          <h3>Header</h3>

          <p>
            The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually
            find the logo and the site’s navigation menu. It’s that steady,
            reliable part of the page that stays visible no matter where
            visitors click on your site.
          </p>
        </article>

        <img src="" alt="EZ Screen Image" />

        <article>
          <h3>Pre-Header</h3>
          <p>
            The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header.
            It’s often used to display helpful information like your contact
            details, business hours, special offers, or even secondary
            navigation links. Think of it as a small but mighty space for
            quick-access details that your visitors might appreciate seeing
            right away.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Favicon</h3>

          <p>
            A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to
            your website title. It’s usually a simplified version of your logo
            or brand mark. Favicons help visitors quickly identify your website
            when they have multiple tabs open, and they add a polished,
            professional look to your site.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h3>

          <p>
            The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that
            helps visitors find what they’re looking for. These links are
            usually part of the header or located just below it.
          </p>
        </article>
        <img src="" alt="Image" />

        <p>
          On mobile devices, navigation links often transform into an icon with
          three stacked lines—commonly called a “hamburger” menu because it
          resembles a side view of a hamburger. Tapping this icon reveals a
          vertical toggle or horizontal flyout menu, making it easy to browse
          even on smaller screens.
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="Image" />

        <p>
          For more complex websites with tons of pages, you might encounter a
          “mega menu.” This is a dropdown menu that appears when you hover over
          or click a link in the main navigation. It displays multiple
          categories and subcategories, neatly organizing many links—kind of
          like a visual sitemap.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="Image" />

        <h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>
        <p>
          Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their
          location within a website’s hierarchy. They usually appear near the
          top of the page and look something like this:
        </p>
        <p><i>Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title</i></p>
        <h3>Website Content</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or
          body copy, but website content goes beyond just words.
        </p>
        <h3>Homepage (or home page)</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="">homepage</a> — also called the front page or main page
          — is the starting point of most websites. It’s often the first page
          visitors see and serves as a central hub to guide them through your
          site.
        </p>
        <p>Common elements on a home page include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A hero area (headline and image) to grab attention.</li>
          <li>A navigation menu to help visitors find key pages.</li>
          <li>
            Links or sections highlighting your most important content,
            services, or calls to action.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)</h3>
        <p>
          The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs
          your attention and introduces the site’s primary message. It often
          spans the full width of the page and typically includes key elements
          like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A headline that clearly communicates the site’s purpose or the
            problem it solves.
          </li>
          <li>A sub-headline that adds supporting details or context.</li>
          <li>
            A call-to-action button to encourage visitors to take their next
            step, such as scheduling a consultation or exploring services.
          </li>
          <li>
            A visual element, such as an image, graphic, or video, that enhances
            the message and creates visual interest.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="" alt="Image Ulit" />

        <p>
          The term “hero” comes from traditional print media, where it referred
          to the main headline and image meant to grab attention. In web design,
          the hero area serves a similar purpose: to create an immediate and
          lasting impression.
        </p>

        <h3>Slider</h3>
        <p>
          A slider is a feature on a website that displays a rotating series of
          images, like a slideshow. The images usually slide horizontally from
          one to the next, though some sliders use fade effects instead.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="Image" />

        <p>
          You’ll most often find sliders on homepages, either as a replacement
          for a hero image or as an additional design element.
        </p>

        <h3>Alt Text</h3>
        <p>
          Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added
          to images on a website. It serves two main purposes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            It makes websites more accessible by describing images to visually
            impaired users who rely on screen readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            It helps search engines understand what an image is about, which can
            improve your website’s SEO.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sidebar</h3>
        <p>
          A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your
          main website content. It’s often used to display things like
          advertisements, links to other content, calls to action, or a search
          box. Think of it as a supporting area for secondary information that
          complements the primary content.
        </p>

        <img src="" alt="Image" />

        <h3>Sub-Footer</h3>
        <p>
          The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a
          webpage—just above the main footer—and is consistent across your site.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Quick Contact Information:</b> Displaying addresses or phone
            numbers for immediate reference.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Supplementary Navigation Links:</b> Offering shortcuts to key
            pages like “About Us,” “Services,” or even “Our Locations.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Social Media Icons: </b> Allowing visitors easy access to your
            social profiles. Allowing visitors easy access to your social
            profiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Additional Resources:</b> This might include links to site maps
            or ancillary informational pages.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="" alt="Image" />

        <h3>Footer (The "True" Footer)</h3>
        <p>
          The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a
          webpage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Copyright and Legal Disclaimers:</b> Noting trademark rights and
            the copyright year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Policy Links:</b> Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and
            any other legal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Site Map:</b> A detailed breakdown of the website’s structure for
            improved navigation and SEO.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites</h2>
          <h3>WordPress</h3>
          <p>
            WordPress powers <a href="">millions of websites</a> worldwide and
            is one of the most popular tools for building and managing websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of WordPress as the operating system for your website—similar
            to how Windows runs on a PC, macOS on a MacBook, or iOS on an
            iPhone. It’s a content management system (CMS) that allows you to
            easily add, remove, or update content without needing advanced
            technical skills.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s how WordPress works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Themes:</b> A WordPress theme controls how your site looks.
              It’s what transforms WordPress into a functional website. There
              are thousands of themes—some free, some paid—and most can be
              customized to match your company’s brand. Using a theme is far
              faster (and cheaper) than building a website entirely from
              scratch, like we had to do back in the early 2000s.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Plugins:</b> Plugins add functionality to your site, much like
              apps on your phone. With tens of thousands of WordPress plugins
              available, you can add features like contact forms, image
              galleries, site security, shopping carts—pretty much anything you
              can imagine.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post</h3>
          <p>
            This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the
            similarities and differences between WordPress pages and posts,
            which you can find <a href="">here.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Hosting</h3>
          <p>
            To have a website on the internet, it needs to be hosted on a web
            server. Think of hosting as the piece of land where your website
            “lives.” Just like you need land to build a house, you need a server
            to store your website’s files and make them available to people on
            the internet.
          </p>
          <h3>Caching</h3>
          <p>
            Caching is the process of storing a temporary version of a website
            or webpage to help it load faster. When someone visits your website,
            a cached version can be delivered quickly instead of forcing the
            browser to fetch everything from scratch.
          </p>
          <h3>Domain Name (aka URL)</h3>
          <p>
            A domain name is the address people type into their browser to visit
            a website—like Amazon.com, CNN.com, or markbrinker.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind the scenes, every website is identified by an IP address,
            which is a long string of numbers like 143.398.884.342. But let’s be
            honest—who can remember all those digits? That’s why domain names
            exist: they’re easier to remember and use words instead of numbers
            to identify a website.
          </p>
          <h3>301 Redirect</h3>
          <p>
            A 301 redirect is a way to permanently send visitors (and search
            engines) from one URL to another. It’s often used when you update
            your website’s structure, change a page’s URL, or move your site to
            a new domain
          </p>
          <h3>404 Error Page</h3>
          <p>
            A 404 error page appears when someone tries to visit a page on your
            website that doesn’t exist — either because the page was deleted,
            the URL was mistyped, or the link is broken.
          </p>
          <h3>DNS</h3>
          <p>
            As mentioned earlier, humans use domain names (like markbrinker.com)
            instead of long, hard-to-remember IP addresses. When you type a
            domain name into your web browser, your internet service provider
            (ISP) connects to a domain name server—one of many located around
            the world. The DNS server quickly looks up the IP address linked to
            that domain name and routes you to the website you requested.
          </p>
          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it’s the standard
            language used to create websites and web pages. Invented in 1991 by
            Tim Berners-Lee (the creator of the World Wide Web), HTML allows
            developers to structure content on a webpage using tags for elements
            like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Fun fact:</b> HTML inspired the name of the original Hotmail
            email service, launched in 1996. The founders cleverly included
            “HTML” in the name to highlight the web-based nature of their email
            platform.
          </p>
          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create
            the structure of a webpage, CSS is what makes it look good. It
            controls the design—things like fonts, colors, spacing, and layout.
          </p>
          <h3>Website Builder</h3>
          <p>
            A <b>website builder</b> is an all-in-one tool that allows you to
            design and build a website without needing to write code. Website
            builders typically feature drag-and-drop editors, making them easy
            to use, even for those with minimal technical experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Mobile Responsive</h3>
          <p>
            A mobile responsive website automatically morphs to fit the shape
            and size of the screen it’s being viewed on—whether that’s a phone,
            tablet, or desktop. It uses CSS to adjust the layout, navigation,
            and font sizes seamlessly, so the site is easy to use and read on
            any device.
          </p>
          <h3>SSL</h3>
          <p>
            SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. An SSL certificate encrypts the
            data sent between a website’s server and your browser, ensuring that
            hackers can’t intercept or read it.
          </p>
          <h3>SEO</h3>
          <p>
            SEO can seem like a large and complex topic—and it is—but at its
            core, it’s about creating content that search engines value and
            people actually want. To get ranked in the organic search listings,
            you need to produce content that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is high quality and genuinely helpful.</li>
            <li>People actually want to read, share, or link to.</li>
            <li>Is properly formatted on your site (known as On-Page SEO).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="">Google Analytics</a> is a free service from Google that
            provides statistics about your website—like how many visitors you’re
            getting, which pages they’re viewing, and how long they’re spending
            on each page.
          </p>
          <h3>Email Service Provider (ESP)</h3>
          <p>
            An <a href="">email service provider</a>(sometimes called an email
            management service or EMS) helps you build, manage, and communicate
            with your list of email subscribers.
          </p>
          <p>Using an email service provider offers several key benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Automation:</b> Users can add or remove themselves from your
              list automatically. You can also set up emails to send based on
              specific user actions (e.g., signing up for your list).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Scalability:</b> Send a single broadcast email to hundreds or
              thousands of subscribers with just a click—something that’s nearly
              impossible to do manually.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Deliverability:</b> Email service providers are “whitelisted,”
              so your messages are less likely to be flagged as spam. If you try
              sending too many emails in quick succession with tools like
              Outlook or Gmail, your ISP might block them.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            I hope you found this mini crash course on website terminology
            helpful.

            The good news? You don’t need to understand all the tech behind the
            scenes to have productive conversations with a web designer or
            developer. A basic grasp of these terms is more than enough to help
            you feel confident and informed.

            I’ll be updating this glossary over time, so if there’s a term I
            missed or one you think should be added, let me know in the comments
            below. Thanks for reading!
